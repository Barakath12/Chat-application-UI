my_chatbotSmart Chat UI
Smart Chat UI is a sleek and responsive web-based chatbot interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates a simple conversational experience with predefined responses, making it a great starting point for building interactive chat applications.

Features

Modern UI Design: Clean layout with a stylish header, message bubbles, and responsive input area.
Simulated Chatbot Responses: Replies to common keywords like "hello", "help", "test", and "bye".
Responsive Layout: Optimized for desktop and mobile screens using Flexbox.
Custom Styling: Uses the "Poppins" font and a soft color palette for a pleasant user experience.
Interactive Messaging: Messages appear with a slight delay to mimic real-time conversation.

How It Works

User Input: Type a message in the input field and click "Send".
Message Display: Your message appears on the right (.sent), and the bot's reply appears on the left (.received).
Reply Logic: The bot checks for keywords and responds accordingly using the generateReply() function.
Reply Logic

javascript if (msg.includes("hello") || msg.includes("hi")) { return "Hi there! ðŸ˜Š How can I assist you today?"; } else if (msg.includes("help")) { return "Sure! Let me know what you need help with."; } else if (msg.includes("test")) { return "Testing successful! Everything looks good."; } else if (msg.includes("bye")) { return "Goodbye! Have a great day!"; } else { return "Thank you for your message!"; } 

Customization Ideas

Integrate with a backend or AI API for dynamic responses.
Add timestamps or avatars to messages.
Enhance with speech recognition or voice output.
Store chat history using local storage or a database.
